Tone of Voice – Brand Guidance for Sage

Our tone of voice brings to life who we are through how we speak. It’s an essential piece of our overall brand identity. Together with our visual identity, our verbal tone creates distinctive and magnetic impressions.

### Why tone of voice matters

**Externally**  
- It works alongside our visual identity and adapts to the audience.  
- It guides all communication, from product naming to UX copy.  
- It shapes big moments (ads) and small ones (chat, IVR, support, sales scripts, courses).

**Internally**  
- It runs through internal comms: signage, speeches, onboarding, announcements.  
- It gives personality to how we speak to each other at Sage.

We believe businesses are powered by human ambition—not just technology. Our tone helps people focus on the human side of business. It builds confidence and gives customers and colleagues a sense of possibility.

## Our Four Core Values – and How They Shape Tone of Voice

Our tone is defined by four values. Each value influences how we speak across channels and audiences:

### 1. Human  
Friendly and conversational – never condescending.  
Like a confident, tech-savvy friend: charming, warm, empathetic.

**Best practices**  
- Use conversational language, especially for familiar audiences.  
- Use warm greetings and sign-offs (e.g., “Hey there!”, “We can’t wait to see you there.”).  
- Use exclamation marks sparingly.  

**By audience**  
- **Small businesses**: From dry technical to friendly and clear.  
  > From: "Take control of your bookkeeping…"  
  > To: "Take the ugh out of accounting…"  
- **Medium businesses**: From rigid to personality-filled.  
- **Internal**: From formal to conversational and relevant.
